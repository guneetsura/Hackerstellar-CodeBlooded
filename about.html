        <p>
          The Chain Reaction is a blockchain-based supply chain management
          application that provides real-time visibility and tracking of goods
          and products throughout the entire supply chain. It enables companies
          to query a product's status and location at any point in time and
          facilitates secure and transparent transactions between suppliers,
          manufacturers, and distributors through self-executing smart
          contracts. The app aims to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and
          provide transparency in the supply chain.
